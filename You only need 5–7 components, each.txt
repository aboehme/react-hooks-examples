You only need 5–7 components, each in its own folder or repo.

Here’s a killer lineup (you’re already halfway there):

1️⃣ Expandable Card

boolean state

conditional rendering

clean JSX

2️⃣ Character Counter

controlled input

derived values

validation UI

3️⃣ Delayed Greeting (useEffect)

mount-only effect

timer

state update after render

4️⃣ Data Fetcher (mock or real API)

loading state

error handling

useEffect dependencies

5️⃣ Modal or Dropdown

show/hide

keyboard escape handling (bonus)

composition

That’s it.
